%TODO: update this information

In this chapter we will briefly discuss some reports of the application of Evolutionary Computation and related method for Earthquake Risk Analysis.\\

The usage of Evolutionary Computation in the field of earthquake risk models is somewhat sporadic. Zhang and Wang~\cite{Zhang2012} used Genetic Algorithms to fine tune an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and use this system to produce a forecast model. Zhou and Zu~\cite{Feiyan2014} also proposed a combination of ANN and EC, but their system only forecasts the magnitude parameter of earthquakes. Sadat, in the paper~\cite{sadat2015application}, follows the idea oF Zhou and Zu, aiming to predict the magnitude of the earthquakes in North Iran, but in this case, he used ANN and GA.\\

Some sismological models were developed aiming to estimate parameter values by using Evolutionarry Computation. For example, Evolutionary Computation was used to estimate the peak ground acceleration of seismically active areas~\cite{pga_Kerh,Kermani2009,Cabalar2009,Kerh2010,Kerh2015}. Ramos~\cite{Ramos2011} used Genetic Algorithms to decide the location of sensing stations and Saeidian~\cite{saeidian2016evaluation} made a comparation in performance between the GA and Bees Algorithm to decide which of those techniques would performe better when chosing the location of sensing stations. Nicknam et al.~\cite{Nicknam2010} and Kennett and Sambridge~\cite{Kennett1992} used evolutionary computation to determine the Fault Model parameters of a earthquake.\\

Huda and Santosa \cite{ijse5762} published a paper in which the goal is to find, via Genetic Algorithm, the speed of the wavesP and S in the mantle and in the earth crust. P waves are indicated as the first fault found  in seismological data and S waves are the changes caused in the phase of a P wave~\cite{ijse5762}. This research aims to obtain a structure of the japanese undergound and geographically focuses in the same region as our work.\\
